:::{admonition} Demo launch time

It takes about **one minute** to launch the kernel once you open one of the
below demos if an image is available. However, if the kernel hasn't been
launched since new updates were pushed to the
[stable](https://github.com/ComPWA/compwa-org/tree/stable) branch, it can take
around **10 minutes** for Binder to build an image.

:::

The following notebooks illustrate some key features of {mod}`qrules`,
{mod}`ampform`, and {mod}`tensorwaves`. Since they are meant to be run
directly, they are hosted on [Binder](https://mybinder.rtfd.io), but they can
also be found [here](https://github.com/ComPWA/compwa-org/tree/main/demo).
