# Demos

The following notebooks illustrate some key features of {mod}`qrules`,
{mod}`ampform`, and {mod}`tensorwaves`. Since they are meant to be run
directly, they are hosted on [Binder](https://mybinder.rtfd.io), but they can
also be found [here](https://github.com/ComPWA/compwa-org/tree/main/demo).
