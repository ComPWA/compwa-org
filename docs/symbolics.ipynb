    "Amplitude analysis is a method that is used intensively in particle and hadron physics experiments. It allows us to describes the intensity distributions obtained from the experiments with the use of amplitude models. These allow us to extract parameters about intermediate states appearing in the scattering processes, which are governed by the electroweak force and the strong force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complicated nature of the strong force, described by Quantum Chromodynamics, makes it difficult to derive intensity models from first principles. Instead, we have to rely on approximations given specific assumptions for the scattering process that we study. Each amplitude model that we formulate, is almost always merely an approximation of the true scattering process. As a consequence, we always have to reassess our analysis results and try alternative models. In addition, amplitude models can be extremely complicated, with large, complex-valued parametrizations and dozens of input parameters. We therefore want to evaluate these models with as much information as possible. That means large input data samples and 'fits' using the full likelihood function, which provides us a multidimensional description of the data by using event-based, unbinned fit methods.\n",

    "The 2010s saw the release of a number of Python packages for highly optimized numerical computational backends that gained popularity within the data science and Machine Learning communities. Examples of these are [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) (2012), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) (2015), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) (2016), and [JAX](https://jax.rtfd.io) (2018). Just like NumPy, the core of these packages is written in highly performant languages like C++, but apply several smart techniques to make the computations even faster. The main techniques that these backends apply are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Just-In-Time Compilation** (JIT): Python code is compiled if and only if it is run. JIT not only offers performance in a dynamic workflow, but also allows the compiler to optimize the code at runtime based on the actual data input.\n",
    "- **Hardware acceleration**: JIT compilation is performed through an intermediate, device-agnostic layer of code (particularly [XLA](https://openxla.org/xla)), which allows the user to run their code not only on regular CPUs, but also on different types of hardware accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs.\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: array-oriented computations can automatically parallelized over multiple CPU cores (multithreading) or multiple CPU, GPU or TPU devices (multiprocessing).\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation**: Many of these libraries can automatically compute derivatives, which is useful for gradient-based optimization algorithms. While this functionality was designed with linear Machine Learning models in mind, it can be used to compute exact gradients over mathematical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are usually directly available with minor changes to existing [array-oriented code](#array-oriented). In most cases, it is just a matter of decorating the array-oriented function with a JIT-compile decorator and, where needed, replacing the calls to vectorized functions (such as summing up a column in two-dimensional array) with their accelerated equivalents."

    "The combination of a CAS, performant code generation, and a dynamically typed language like Python is ideal when working with Jupyter notebooks. Amplitude models can be built up interactively with the option to directly inspect their implementation as mathematical formulas or plot their behavior with visualization libraries. Fast, numerical performance is near at hand through automatic code generation, which bridges the gap between formulating amplitude models to performing fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ties in perfectly with recent trends in data science and modern publishing tools. In recent years, there have been several initiatives that render Jupyter notebooks as publication-ready documents (websites, PDF files, etc.). Community-wide examples are the [Executable Book Project](https://executablebooks.org), [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org), while CERN has launched platforms like [SWAN](https://swan.docs.cern.ch) for running notebooks with direct access to CERN computing resources and [Reana](https://www.reanahub.io) for making analyses more reproducible and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these trends, writing an amplitude analysis with symbolics is therefore not only intuitive to the physicist who write it, but results in a **self-documenting workflow** that naturally evolves towards publication-ready materials. An example is the [polarimetry analysis by LHCb](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP07(2023)228), where the entire implemented amplitude model is [directly rendered from the codebase](https://lc2pkpi-polarimetry.docs.cern.ch/amplitude-model.html#amplitude) as mathematical formulas and analysis results from high-performance computations are directly available through code generation."

    "Amplitude analyses are notoriously hard to reproduce. There are often several ways to formulate the same model, the model complexity makes the source code of the analysis model hard to understand, and starting conditions in a fit can lead to completely different fit results. Formulating the amplitude models symbolically addresses exactly these difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the [self-documenting workflow](#self-documenting-workflow) with symbolic expressions removes the need for readers to dive through the underlying code, as the formulas are directly visible to the reader. Mathematics is the language we all speak. This easily allows others to reimplement models into their own framework of choice, now or in the future, in e.g. new programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, [code generation](#code-generation) makes it possible to serialize symbolic amplitude models to human-readable format for preservation on disk or sharing with others. For example, just as with the generation of numerical functions, the model's [expression tree](#expression-trees) can be used to generate nodes in a serialization format like YAML or JSON. Other analysis frameworks can then import the model for cross-checks or for adapting the analysis to other experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a technical note, the Python ecosystem in combination with Jupyter Notebooks and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) (a documentation builder) makes it possible for any reader to directly rerun analysis in the browser or in some local environment. [Pinned dependencies](https://github.com/ComPWA/update-pip-constraints) ensure that the analysis produces the same results."

    "Exciting times are coming for amplitude analysis studies. On the one hand, collider experiments are producing increasingly large data samples that provide high statistics that are suitable for amplitude analysis and challenge the tools that are on the market. On the other hand, computational power has become so widely available, that it becomes possible to perform fits with more complicated models over large data input. While this provides many opportunities, it also poses challenges to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many physicists who have little background in amplitude analysis, but need to become familiar with the theory and the techniques. For now, however, the literature is sparse, highly technical, and often specific to the experiment for which it was written. This makes the learning curve for newcomers extremely steep, so that it takes a lot of time before one can perform an actual amplitude analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As amplitude models become more complex, it becomes crucial to get input from other experiments. This requires a proper matching of amplitude models and therefore it is essential that the models become more reproducible, extendable, and portable. All of this makes it paramount for the amplitude analysis community to provide easy access to the basic principles of the theoretical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolics can play a valuable role here as well, as it becomes much easier to share and maintain knowledge gained about amplitude models and amplitude analysis theory. Symbolic amplitude models directly show the implemented mathematics and their numerical functions can directly be used for interactive visualizations. In addition, the [self-documenting workflow](#self-documenting-workflow) makes it more inviting to contribute to community documentation as it narrows the gap between theory and code."
