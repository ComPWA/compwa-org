# Demonstration of ComPWA software packages

The following Jupyter notebooks are hosted as interactive presentations on
[compwa-org.rtfd.io/en/stable/demo.html](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demo.html)
and illustrates what the
[several packages by the ComPWA organization](https://pwa.readthedocs.io/software.html#affiliated-projects)
have to offer.

As opposed to
[Technical Reports](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reports.html)
and [ADRs](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/adr.html), these
notebooks should work for the latest releases of all ComPWA packages.

There are two types of notebooks:

1. [Interactive apps](https://github.com/binder-examples/appmode). These run
   all cells directly when the notebook is launched, but _do not show input
   cells_.

2. Normal [Jupyter RISE](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-rise)
   demos. In these notebooks, input cells can be made visible, but the visitors
   have to run all cells themselves.

To activate 1., add a Markdown cell with the following comment:

```markdown
<!-- app-mode -->
```
