    "Amplitude analysis is a method that is used intensively in particle and hadron physics experiments. The method allows us to describes the intensity distributions obtained from the experiments with the use of amplitude models. Amplitude models allow us to extract parameters about intermediate states appearing in the scattering processes, which are governed by the electroweak force and the strong force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complicated nature of the strong force, described by Quantum Chromodynamics, makes it difficult to derive intensity models from first principles. Instead, we have to rely on approximations given specific assumptions for the scattering process that we study. Each amplitude model that we formulate, is almost always merely an approximation of the true scattering process. As a consequence, we always have to reassess our analysis results and try alternative models. In addition, amplitude models can be extremely complicated, with large, complex-valued parametrizations and dozens of input parameters. We therefore want to evaluate these models with as much information as possible. That means large input data samples and 'fits' using the full likelihood function, which provides us a multidimensional description of the data by using event-based, unbinned fit methods.\n",

    "The 2010s saw the release of a number of Python packages for highly optimized numerical computational backends that gained popularity within the data science and Machine Learning communities. Examples of these are [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) (2012), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) (2015), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) (2016), and [JAX](https://jax.rtfd.io) (2018). Just like NumPy, the core of these packages is written in highly performant languages like C++, but apply several smart techniques to make the computations even faster. The main techniques that these backends apply are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Just-In-Time Compilation** (JIT): Python code is compiled if and only if it is run. JIT not only offers performance in a dynamic workflow, but also allows the compiler to optimize the code at runtime based on the actual data input.\n",
    "- **Hardware acceleration**: JIT compilation is performed through an intermediate, device-agnostic layer of code (particularly [XLA](https://openxla.org/xla)), which allows the user to run their code not only on regular CPUs, but also on different types of hardware accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs.\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: array-oriented computations can automatically parallelized over multiple CPU cores (multithreading) or multiple CPU, GPU or TPU devices (multiprocessing).\n",
    "- **Automatic Differentiation**: Many of these libraries can automatically compute derivatives, which is useful for gradient-based optimization algorithms. While this functionality was designed with linear Machine Learning models in mind, it can be used to compute exact gradients over mathematical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are usually directly available with minor changes to existing [array-oriented code](#array-oriented). In most cases, it is just a matter of decorating the array-oriented function with a JIT-compile decorator and, where needed, replacing the calls to vectorized functions (such as summing up a column in two-dimensional array) with their accelerated equivalents."
